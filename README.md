# Matplotlib.odin

This project binds Matplotlib library to the Odin language.

This is initial stage of the project and testing the idea on linux and python3.10. Other version of python and OS will be added later.

The idea is completely stolen from [lava/matplotlib-cpp](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp)

## Quick start

Initialize venv:
```bash
make python310
```

Source venv:
```bash
source venv310/bin/activate
```

Compile and run sample:
```bash
make all
```
